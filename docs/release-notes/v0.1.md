# marketui v0.1

Welcome the initial public release of marketui!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaur/marketui/media/media/v0.1.png)

This project provides a web page that you download and open locally to quickly check Poloniex order books.

There is so much more to do but I'd like to share what already works:

- show/update a list of markets and their prices
- show/update order books for a selected market (up to 100 price levels)
- updating is done manually for now

It is not too exciting when you have to _click_ to update (what?!) _but_ it already shows 100 price levels for each book vs 50 in the new Poloniex UI. And because it is so light and local you can check prices and books in sub-second time.

Next milestone is to update books and markets automatically. A bunch of code for that is already there and working but it is deactivated until I fix a few remaining edge cases.

Credits: I would like to thank Poloniex for shutting down the nice-and-just-works old UI in favor of the new fancy-and-inconvenient one, for giving me enough impulse to kickstart this journey.

Expectations: This is a small hobby project to get the most needed data and learn some web stack along the way. Please don't expect much ;)

Check the [README](https://github.com/xaur/marketui#installation) for usage instructions.

Happy book reading!
