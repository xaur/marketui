# marketui v0.2

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaur/marketui/media/media/v0.2.png)

This is a long-overdue feature and bugfix release. I planned to include WebSocket books too (with _full_ depth) but didn't make it due to lack of time. Since this version has served well for months, let's release it anyway.

Highlight of this release is the opt-in automatic updating of market and book tables. I found manual update mode still valuable so keeping it for now.

User-facing changes:

- added checkbox toggle to enable auto-updating of market and book data
- show selected market price in browser tab title
- show base currency code (ticker) in book column header
- made tables a bit wider to fit longer numbers
- added thin 1 px border around tables
- slightly reduced font size to fit more stuff
- removed bluish background from tables
- fixed book scroll position not getting reset when selecting a different market

Internal changes:

- added graceful cancellation of requests
- fixed possibility to start concurrent requests for book or market data (watching books for multiple markets is not supported for now)
- extracted and reused code for handling fetches and auto-updating
- did some separation of "business" data from UI state data (and code updating them)
- reduced the amount of logging
- fixed ~10 bugs (mostly state management and error handling)

Full list of changes is [here](https://github.com/xaur/marketui/compare/v0.1...v0.2).

I learned something about promises and error handling. TL;DR: promises are error-prone (surprised?). I'm recording my web dev "adventures" in the Git log, mostly for myself, but you may find it fun to read too.
